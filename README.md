Coding a simple neural network for solving XOR problem in Python without ML library

****************************
**Exercise :** In the python file SimpleDeepForwardNetwork.py, you will create code for a neural network which performs the the exclusive OR or XOR operation which is not linearly separable function. The truth table of the XOR looks like this:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 4 | 4 | 0|
| 2 | 4 | -1 |
| 4 | 2 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 0 |

In words, the XOR function is 0 if both inputs are the same, or 1 if both inputs are different. Hence, the reason it is known as exclusive OR.

The following elements are required:

1. An input weight tensor
2. A hidden layer with 5 units using sigmoid activation
3. A output weight tensor
4. An output unit with sigmoid activation

There are 4 possible test (input) cases. Test your code for all cases.
